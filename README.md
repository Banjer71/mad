## My Abbreviations Dictionary

- It's a fact......English people love abbreviations and not only them but I found out they are the ones who definetely use them a lot in everyday life!!

- That's why I decided to build a simple CRUD application with Node and Express for helping me to collect all the abbreviations my collegues use at work and at the same time practising with Node and Express.

### First step

> Create a node webserver using express framework

> Create the CRUD basic functionality ...Create, Read, Update, Delete.

> Use the node fs module to write and read a file that I will use a temporary database

### Second Step

> Connect the application to a real database
